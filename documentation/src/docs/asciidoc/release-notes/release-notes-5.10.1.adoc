[[release-notes-5.10.1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Method predicates are now applied while searching the type hierarchy. This fixes bugs
  in `findMethods(...)` and `streamMethods(...)` in `ReflectionSupport` as well as
  `findAnnotatedMethods(...)` in `AnnotationSupport`.
  - See link:https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3498[issue 3498] for details.


[[release-notes-5.10.1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* A package-private class-level lifecycle method annotated with `@BeforeAll` or
  `@AfterAll` is no longer _shadowed_ by a method-level lifecycle method annotated with
  `@BeforeEach` or `@AfterEach` when the method-level lifecycle method resides in a
  different package and has the same name as the class-level lifecycle method.
  - See link:https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3498[issue 3498] for details.
* The `RandomNumberExtension` example in the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-RandomNumberExtension, User Guide>> has been
  updated to properly support `Integer` types as well as non-static field injection.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Improved Javadoc for `Assertions.assertTimeoutPreemptively` regarding thread interrupt.
* Documentation for `@Disabled` and conditional annotations now explicitly explains that
  such annotations are not inherited by subclasses.
